Week 4 Progress Check
==================
This repo is a possible progress check for the DevMountain students. The [ToBeFixed branch](https://github.com/dantreasure/Week4ProgressCheck/tree/ToBeFixed) of this repo contains what will be given to the students including instructions in the README.md. This README.md contains [a link](http://bit.ly/fran-and-franks-diner) to what the finished product should look like.

The tasks test the student's knowledge of Git, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.
